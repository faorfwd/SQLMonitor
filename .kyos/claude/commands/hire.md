# /kyos:hire

> Stock the repo with the support it is missing before the next feature run trips over the same obvious gaps.

## Trigger

Run this when the codebase has grown into a stack that the surrounding guidance has not caught up with.

You usually need it after:

- adding a new runtime, framework, or hosted service
- introducing tooling that should be reachable through MCP
- noticing that future work depends on conventions nobody has written down yet
- seeing generic agent or skill folders where the repo clearly needs sharper specialization

## End state

This command is successful when the repo gains practical support, not when it produces the longest list of additions.

Useful outcomes include:

- a newly registered MCP in `.mcp.json`
- a reusable skill or agent stub added from `catalog/registry.json`
- a repo-owned skill stub under `.claude/skills/` for repo-specific practices (commit it)
- a blunt note that says what still has no good support

## Triage order

Work in this order:

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/commands/project-context.md`.
2. Inspect current support surfaces: `.mcp.json`, `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/skills/`.
3. Infer the actual stack from docs and repo signals.
4. Look for the highest-value gaps, not every possible gap.
5. Pull in catalog-backed additions where the match is obvious.
6. Write local scaffolding where the repo needs something custom.

## Selection policy

- Choose additions that reduce friction for upcoming work.
- Skip anything that is technically relevant but not actually useful yet.
- Prefer a small honest setup over a bloated pretend-complete setup.
- If there is no good fit, say so plainly and leave a local note.

## Things this command should not do

- write application features
- register tools just because they look impressive
- hide missing support behind generic placeholders
- treat the first setup pass as final

## Example prompts

```text
/kyos:hire
/kyos:hire prepare this repo for oauth, redis, and github actions
/kyos:hire we are introducing background jobs and object storage next
```

## What Claude should return

The result should read like a field report:

- what the repo seems to be using
- what support already exists
- what was added
- what was intentionally skipped
- what still needs a human decision or custom repo knowledge

## Hand-off

Once the repo support layer is in better shape, continue with `/kyos:spec`, `/kyos:tech`, or `/kyos:implement`.
