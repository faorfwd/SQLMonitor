# /kyos:tasks

> Break the current technical plan into concrete, ordered work slices that can be executed and checked without losing the bigger picture.

## When to use it

Use this after the feature has both a functional spec and a technical approach, but before implementation starts sprawling across too many moving parts at once.

## What this should leave behind

- a short list of execution slices in a sensible order
- clear dependencies between slices
- a note about what can be checked after each slice
- a path into implementation that does not require rethinking the whole feature every time

## Inputs to read

- the current feature spec
- the technical plan
- current repo context and obvious code hotspots

## How to break work down

1. Start from the end-to-end feature outcome.
2. Split the work into thin slices that can be completed and checked independently.
3. Separate foundational work from user-facing work.
4. Call out blockers, sequencing constraints, and anything that can run in parallel.
5. Keep each slice small enough that progress is visible.

## What good task slicing looks like

- each task changes a coherent part of the system
- each task has a visible outcome
- each task has a natural verification point
- the ordering reduces rework and merge pain

## Example prompts

```text
/kyos:tasks
/kyos:tasks split the OAuth feature into execution slices
/kyos:tasks turn the CSV import tech plan into ordered implementation work
```

## What Claude should return

The result should read like an execution board:

- task name
- why it exists
- what it depends on
- what "done" means

## Next in flow

Continue with [`/kyos:implement`](./implement.md) to execute the slices one by one.

## Where to save the result

Write the execution slices into a repo-owned markdown file so it can be reviewed and committed:

- `docs/execution/<spec-slug>/tasks.md`

Use the same `<spec-slug>` chosen in `/kyos:spec` (the folder created under `docs/execution/`).
